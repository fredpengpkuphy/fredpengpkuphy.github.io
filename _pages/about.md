I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest mainly focuses on physics of AI, scaling laws and training dynamics of LLMs. I'm also developing my interest in physics-guided generative models.

I'm now advised by Ziming Liu from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
