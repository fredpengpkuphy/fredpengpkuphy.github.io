I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest mainly focuses on physics of AI, scaling laws and training dynamics of LLMs. I'm also developing my interest in physics-guided generative models.

I'm now advised by Ziming Liu from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
