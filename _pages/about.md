I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I'm now advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/) from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

Research interest
======
My research interest mainly focuses on physics of AI. Instead of improving the number of model parameters without any consideration, I believe that to achieve AGI, we need a more fundamental understanding of AI. Through experiments that progress from simple to complex, we can discover patterns and thereby establish a complete physical model of the AI system. This physical model can then guide us in designing more advanced and reasonable models.

To be more detailed, I'm interested in the training dynamics of LLMs, the essence behind the neural scaling law. I'm also developing my interest in physics-guided generative models.

Research experience
======
My first research project started from my freshman year, in which I conducted a project with an engineering-oriented approach advised by [Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). The core of it was to leverage the context learning capabilities of the large language model and the retrieval-augmented generation technology to enhance the image reasoning ability of the LLMs. The project has reached the final stage.

My second research project(advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/)) is about the bias of activation functions, in which I attempt to investigate the influence of the activation function bias on initialization, training stability and convergence performance. I am currently trying to adjust the activation values by means of shifting, scaling, and even by trying to incorporate new normalization layers in order to optimize the training process. The project is still in the early stage.

Selected publications
======
In my freshman year, I participated in LLM medical image segmentation competition held by [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) and led the team to win the championship. Although it was a small intramural event, it still provided me with significant valuable experience.
