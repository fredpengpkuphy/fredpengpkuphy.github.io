I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I'm now advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/) from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

Research interest
======
My research interest mainly focuses on physics of AI and training dynamics.

- **Neural Scaling Law**: Investigating the theoretical foundations and underlying nature of neural scaling laws.

- **Neural thermodynamic law**: Understanding the training dynamics from the perspective of thermodynamics.

- **Central Flow**: Analyzing gradient flow dynamics in the center of weight space and developing optimization algorithms inspired by these insights.

- **Hessian and Sharpness**: Examining the geometric properties of the loss landscape to understand their impact on training speed, convergence behavior, and model robustness.

- **Edge of Stability**: Characterizing its behavior and performance in momentum-based optimizers such as Adam.

- **Physics-Guided Generative Models**: Developing generative AI frameworks that explicitly incorporate physical laws and constraints as inductive biases.


Research experience
======
My first research project, advised by [Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), was about image question-answering. We discovered that leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and integrating RAG technology can improve the performance on downstream reasoning tasks. The project has reached the final stage.

My second research project(advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/)) is about the bias of activation functions. We found that simple changes(e.g., shifting) in activation functions can lead to unexpected speed-up on toy tasks. We are now investigating the underlying mechanism and whether the benefit could scale up to large models.

Competition experience
======
In my freshman year, I participated in LLM medical image segmentation competition held by [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) and led the team to win the championship. Although it was a small intramural event, it still provided me with significant valuable experience.
