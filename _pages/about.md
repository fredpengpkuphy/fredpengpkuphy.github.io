I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I'm now advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/) from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

Research experience

My first research project started from my freshman year, in which I conducted a project with an engineering-oriented approach advised by [Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). The core of it was to leverage the context learning capabilities of the large language model and the retrieval-augmented generation technology to enhance the image reasoning ability of the LLMs. The project has reached the final stage.

My second research project(advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/)) is about the bias of activation functions, in which I attempt to investigate the influence of the activation function bias on initialization, training stability and convergence performance. I am currently trying to adjust the activation values by means of shifting, scaling, and even by trying to incorporate new normalization layers in order to optimize the training process. The project is still in the early stage.
