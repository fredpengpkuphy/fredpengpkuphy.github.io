I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest mainly focuses on physics of AI, scaling laws and training dynamics of LLMs. I'm also developing my interest in physics-guided generative models.

I'm now advised by [Ziming Liu](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/) from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

Research experience
======
My first research program started from my freshman year, in which I conducted a project with an engineering-oriented approach advised by [Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). The core of it was to leverage the context learning capabilities of the large language model and the retrieval-augmented generation technology to enhance the image reasoning ability of the LLMs. The project has reached the final stage.
